    Welcome to my first blog post! From now on, I'll be trying to do weekly updates on any interesting, recent AI-related topic.

For this week, I'll do an in-depth review on the famous, famous latent/stable diffusion model which basically started the stable diffusion boom last year. 
The reason I'm doing this is because I'm trying to develop a stable diffusion model for my research purposes, which is virtual H&E staining of unstained tissue microarrays. 
Maybe I could do another blog post on this if the project progresses, or about previous works on this topic. For reference purposes, the stable diffusion paper named "High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models" can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10752.pdf).
<strong> Let's dive right in!

### Introduction:
Latent diffusion models (LDM), or henceforth mentioned as stable diffusion models (SD), are a type of a diffusion model 
developed for the purpose of image synthesis by Rombach et al of last year. Like Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), the stable
diffusion model is a type of generative model. Generative models are divided into two
