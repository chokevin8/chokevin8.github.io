In this post, I will briefly describe Class Activation Maps (CAM) and some of its popular subtypes, usages in semantic segmentation,
and then finally post some introductory code and results in utilizing CAM in my own semantic segmentation project using [H&E images](/projects/1_project/)
## **What are Class Activation Maps (CAM) ?**
*Class activation maps*, henceforth referred to as *CAM*, can be thought of as heatmaps that can highlight the regions of a query image that are most important for the
network's classification or segmentation decision. Traditionally, CAMs were developed to be used for image classification, as utilization of CAM was limited to specific types of architectures,
which are CNNs with global average pooling (GAP) and a final fully connected layer. Most image classification models use GAP and a final fully connected layer followed by the output
activation function (assume multi-class, so we use softmax) for turning logits into final prediction probability/results. The last layer before the GAP and fully connected layer is the layer that holds the "feature map",
which captures subtle, fine semantic details of the training images. Therefore, the linear combination of the feature map
This is beautifully summarized in the diagram below:

As seen in the above diagram, the class activation map is generated by a linear combination of the weights in the
