<b> Hi everyone, </b> my name is Kevin (Won June) Cho, and I'm an aspiring AI/DL researcher. I enjoy using various biological and medical data, 
such as RNA-Seq data or H&E images, to study problems in the field of biology and medicine, such as cancer diagnosis/genomics. 
<br>
<br>
I received a bachelor's degree of science (BS) in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from Johns Hopkins University. Currently, I'm pursuing a master's degree of science in engineering in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University. I'm currently pursuing research under
the guidance of Dr. Denis Wirtz in the [Wirtz Lab](https://wirtzlab.johnshopkins.edu/). My personal research is about utilizing deep learning image segmentation model(s) in H&E images to find new digital biomarkers in aging. Please refer to my [CV](/cv/) here for more
information.

<br>
You can find all about me in my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/won-june-kevin-cho-742522174/), and look at my personal work in the [repository](/repositories/) menu. 
Outside of work, I'm a longtime football (or soccer) fan, an avid weightlifter, and a gamer.
You can reach me by <a href="mailto:chokevin8@gmail.com">emailing</a> me or messaging me on LinkedIn. Now feel free to look at my [personal blog](/blog/) or anything else in the submenu, thanks for visiting!
