<b> Hi everyone, </b> my name is Kevin (Won June) Cho, and I'm an aspiring AI/DL researcher. I love using various biological and medical data, 
such as RNA-Seq data or H&E images, to study problems in the field of biology and medicine, such as cancer genomics and diagnosis. My personal research expertise/interest is utilizing deep learning image segmentation model(s) in H&E images to find new digital biomarkers in cancer and aging. 
<br>
<br>
You can find all about me in my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/won-june-kevin-cho-742522174/), and look at my personal work in the [repository](/repositories/) menu. 
Outside of work, I'm a football (or soccer) and american football (or the NFL) maniac (ask me which team I support!) and an avid weightlifter (tell me your workout routine!). 
<br> 
<br>
You can reach me by <a href="mailto:chokevin8@gmail.com">emailing</a> me or messaging me on LinkedIn and I'll be more than glad to have a chat! Now feel free to look at my [deep learning blog](/blog/) or anything else in the submenu!


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

<!-- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
