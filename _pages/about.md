<b> Hi everyone, </b> my name is Kevin (Won June) Cho, and I'm an aspiring AI/DL researcher. I've used biological and medical data, 
such as H&E images and RNA-Seq data to study problems in the field of biology and medicine, such as cancer diagnosis/genomics.
<br>
<br>
I received a bachelor's degree of science (BS) in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 2022. Currently, I'm pursuing a master's degree of science in engineering (MSE) in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University. I'm currently pursuing research under
the guidance of Dr. Denis Wirtz in the [Wirtz Lab](https://wirtzlab.johnshopkins.edu/). **My master's research is about utilizing image segmentation model in skin H&E images to find new digital biomarkers in aging and utilizing generative models to virtually convert different kinds of histological stains.** Please refer to my [resume](/cv/) here for more
information, and for details about my projects, please refer to my [projects page](/projects/) as well.
<br>
<br>
Outside of work, I'm a longtime football (or soccer) fan, an avid weightlifter, and an online gamer.
You can reach me by <a href="mailto:wonjunecho8@gmail.com">emailing</a> me or messaging me on LinkedIn. Now feel free to look at my [personal blog](/blog/) on DL/AI topics or anything else in the submenu, thanks for visiting!
