### **Project Motivation & Background:**
Nucleic acid-based therapeutics have been emergent, as more and more nucleic acid therapeutics are being approved due to their
ability to treat diseases by targeting the genetic blueprint itself. Four main types of nucleic acid-based therapeutics are: 1) antisense
oligonucleotides (ASO), 2) ligand conjugated small interfering RNA (siRNA), 3) adeno-associated virus vectors (AAV), and 4) lipid nanoparticles (LNP).
Recently, more and more nucleic acid-based therapeutics have been approved by the FDA, the most famous being the two COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic (mRNA-
based therapeutic). Recently, the FDA approved Adstiladrin, which is an AAV-based therapeutic for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), so more and more
nucleic acid-based therapeutics are hitting the market in the oncology space as well. 

Compared to conventional therapeutics that usually target proteins that results in transient therapeutic effects, nucleic-acid based therapeutics are often much
longer-lasting or even permanent depending on the nucleic acid used and the target. However, most nucleic-acid based therapies require a carrier, as they will be
targeted by the immune system for degradation and clearance and therefore will cause unwanted inflammation and toxicity that can be detrimental or even fatal to the patient.
*Therefore, this project's research was focused on the design of the lipid nanoparticles, or LNPs, for effective delivery of pDNAs/mRNAs to develop vaccines for malaria/cancer.*

To briefly introduce the background of LNPs, LNPs usually are constituted of four components: 
*The project's main motivation, therefore, is not only for successful delivery of the drug payload, but also about optimizing the formulation of the LNP.*

To briefly introduce the two projects:
<br>
For the *malaria pDNA vaccine project*, the proposed route of administration was oral, or through the mouth. This makes sense, as it is a wide known fact that oral drugs experience a
"first pass effect", where the orally taken drugs go through the intestines and end up in the liver. This is why drugs that do not target cells in the liver cannot be taken
orally as it is often times metabolized in the liver before it even has a chance to circulate in the bloodstream. In addition, the low pH environment of the stomach due to
gastric acid also necessitates a delivery mechanism such as LNPs. However, because the target of the pDNA malaria vaccine is hepatocytes, an oral administration was fitting. Furthermore,
pDNA is used rather than mRNA because pDNA has a more long-lasting effect than mRNAs do, however they are therefore more likely to elicit an unwanted immune response, which was known to be 
alleviated by co-delivery of anti-inflammatory siRNA.

For the *cancer mRNA vaccine project*, the proposed method of administration was intramuscular, or through the muscle tissue. This is the same route of administration as the COVID-19 vaccines,
as it is most effective to elicit a potent immune response. The cancer vaccine can either be prophylactic or therapeutic, but either way, it has to be able to deliver the mRNA that codes for the 
specific tumor-specific antigens (TSA) that the T cells can recognize and kill the tumor cells. In order to ensure this happens effectively, below is the proposed entire uptake and trafficking scheme of the mRNA LNPs:

As we see above, mRNA LNPs are designed to enter the target antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which in our case are dendritic cells (DCs). They enter the cells via endocytosis, and it is important
to design the LNPs in a way so they initiate *endosomal escape*, or else they are degraded by the lysosomes. After escaping the endosome by breaking the barrier of it, the mRNA is released in to the cytoplasm 
of the DCs, which initiates translation of the desired TSAs. Now, in DCs, DCs use the proteasome-TAP pathway as a main, conventional route for cross-presentation of the TSAs via MHC Class I molecules. In short, the 
translated TSA is broken into peptides by the proteasome, and the peptide is translocated by the TAP transporters into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Then, the MHC Class I complex containing peptides
and other molecules are assembled in the ER and transported to the cell surface. Lastly, as seen in the diagram, the CD8+ T-cells recognize the MHC Class 1 complex/molecule via its surface receptor, or T cell receptor (TCR). 
When this cross-presentation is successful, with the help of other signals called co-stimulary signals, the CD8+ T cell is *activated*, meaning it can now detect and kill target tumor cells via recognizing their TSAs.

### **Methods:**
-Some major projects are: 1) Development of an Oral Liver-targeted Prime-and-trap Malaria pDNA Vaccine and 2) Development of an Enhanced mRNA Cancer Vaccine via Direct Transfection to Host Antigen Presenting Cells.

- In Project 1):
• Formulated and screened ~1080 LNPs via cluster-mode in vitro transfection assays and in vivo intrahepatic/intraduodenal injections.
• Tested Ai9 Cre reporter mice for co-delivery of anti-inflammatory siRNA with pDNA for in vivo assays of top formulations. 

- In Project 2):
• Formulated and screened ~1080 LNPs via cluster-mode in vitro transfection and immunostimulatory assays on dendritic cells.
• Tested Ai9 Cre reporter mice for mRNA delivery and participated in subsequent therapeutic and prophylactic mice tumor studies.
