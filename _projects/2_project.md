### **Project Motivation & Background:**
Nucleic acid-based therapeutics have been emergent, as more and more nucleic acid therapeutics are being approved due to their
ability to treat diseases by targeting the genetic blueprint itself. Four main types of nucleic acid-based therapeutics are: 1) antisense
oligonucleotides (ASO), 2) ligand conjugated small interfering RNA (siRNA), 3) adeno-associated virus vectors (AAV), and 4) lipid nanoparticles (LNP).
For example, the FDA approved Adstiladrin, which is a 
viral vector-based Conventional therapeutics
