### **Project Motivation & Background:**
Nucleic acid-based therapeutics have been emergent, as more and more nucleic acid therapeutics are being approved due to their
ability to treat diseases by targeting the genetic blueprint itself. Four main types of nucleic acid-based therapeutics are: 1) antisense
oligonucleotides (ASO), 2) ligand conjugated small interfering RNA (siRNA), 3) adeno-associated virus vectors (AAV), and 4) lipid nanoparticles (LNP).
Recently, more and more nucleic acid-based therapeutics have been approved by the FDA, the most famous being the two COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic (mRNA-
based therapeutic). Recently, the FDA approved Adstiladrin, which is an AAV-based therapeutic for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), so more and more
nucleic acid-based therapeutics are hitting the market in the oncology space as well. 

Compared to conventional therapeutics that usually target proteins that results in transient therapeutic effects, nucleic-acid based therapeutics are often much
longer-lasting or even permanent depending on the nucleic acid used and the target. However, most nucleic-acid based therapies require a carrier, as they will be
targeted by the immune system for degradation and clearance and therefore will cause unwanted inflammation that can be deterimental or even fatal to the patient.
Therefore, this project's research was focused on the design of the lipid nanoparticles, or LNPs, for effective delivery of pDNAs/mRNAs to develop vaccines for malaria/cancer.

For the malaria pDNA vaccine project, the proposed method of administration was oral, or through the mouth. This makes sense, as it is a wide known fact that oral drugs experience a
"first pass effect", where the orally taken drugs go through the intestines and end up in the liver. This is why drugs that do not target cells in the liver cannot be taken
orally as it is often times metabolized in the liver before it even has a chance to circulate in the bloodstream. What's more, the low pH environment of the stomach due to
gastric acid also necessitates a delivery mechanism such as LNPs. However, because the target of the pDNA malaria vaccine is hepatocytes, an oral administration was fitting. 



Let's also look at some of the background of LNPs. First,

### **Methods:**
-Some major projects are: 1) Development of an Oral Liver-targeted Prime-and-trap Malaria pDNA Vaccine and 2) Development of an Enhanced mRNA Cancer Vaccine via Direct Transfection to Host Antigen Presenting Cells.

- In Project 1):
• Formulated and screened ~1080 LNPs via cluster-mode in vitro transfection assays and in vivo intrahepatic/intraduodenal injections.
• Tested Ai9 Cre reporter mice for co-delivery of anti-inflammatory siRNA with pDNA for in vivo assays of top formulations. 

- In Project 2):
• Formulated and screened ~1080 LNPs via cluster-mode in vitro transfection and immunostimulatory assays on dendritic cells.
• Tested Ai9 Cre reporter mice for mRNA delivery and participated in subsequent therapeutic and prophylactic mice tumor studies.
