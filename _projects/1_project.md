### **Project Motivation & Background:**
<br>
**Let's play a simple guessing game: Look at the two pictures below. At the most left is the ground truth IHC image to be converted. The next two images on the right
is the ground truth H&E version of the ground truth IHC image and the virtually stained H&E version of the ground truth IHC image. Can you guess which is "real" and
which is "fake"?**
