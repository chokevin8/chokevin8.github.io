### **Motivation and Background:**
Let's play a simple guessing game: Look at the pictures below. Can you guess who is older?

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/1_project/real_95yr_man.png" title="95 Year Old Man" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/1_project/Tom_Brady_44yr_old.png" title="44 Year Old Tom Brady" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    On the left, we have a 95 year old man, and on the right, we have 44 year old Tom Brady. 
</div>

*Pretty obvious, right?* Obviously left man is older and right man (Tom Brady) is younger. 
Now, assume we were able to receive the skin tissue samples of both men, cut them into serial sections, applied H&E stain to them, scanned/digitized them, 
and then looked at one part of the whole slide images (WSI). Two pairs of pictures are shown below, and each man's H&E pictures are on the 
left and the right. ***Can you answer the same question now?***

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/1_project/44yr_4x.PNG" title="44yr_4x" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/1_project/95yr_4x.PNG" title="95yr_4x" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/1_project/44yr_20x.PNG" title="44yr_20x" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/1_project/95yr_20x.PNG" title="95yr_20x" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Which tissue belongs to the 95-year old man? The one on the left or the right?
</div>

The answer is: ***44-year old Tom Brady is on the left, and 95-year old man is on the right.*** While these tissues are not actually from the people
pictured above, they actually are tissue samples from patients who are 44-year old and 95-year old. *The point is, compared to just looking at someone's face, 
it's much harder to determine a person's age by just looking at their skin H&E tissue sample.* But someone may ask, ***Why do we want to do this? Why study aging, 
specifically in skin H&E tissue samples?***

Well, it's a well-known fact that old age is correlated with virtually every disease that are the leading causes of death- heart disease, cancer, stroke, Alzheimer's, and recently,
COVID-19. And as we've seen above, the easiest way of telling the approximate age of someone is to look at their face, or *skin*. However, like any other organs, skin function also
deteriorates with age. For example, as we age, the skin loses its structural integrity and self-renewal capabilities, and experiences increased
inflammation and poor temperature regulation. Look at the below diagram:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/1_project/skin_background.png" title="Skin Background" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Diagram comparing major differences between young and old skin. Diagram from <i>Orioli et al (Cells 2018) Epigenetic Regulation of Skin Cells in Natural Aging and Premature Aging Diseases</i>.
</div>

As seen in the above diagram, we already know the major differences
