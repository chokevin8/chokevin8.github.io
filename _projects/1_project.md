### **Project Motivation & Background:**
<br>

**Let's play a simple guessing game:** Look at the two pictures below. At the most left is the ground truth IHC image to be converted. The next two images on the right
are the ground truth H&E version of the ground truth IHC image and the virtually stained H&E version of the ground truth IHC image. Can you guess which is "real" and
which is "fake"?

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/1_project/ihc2_he_intro.png" title="IHC2HE_intro" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

The correct answer is that the images in the right (column) are the "fake" ones, or the ones sampled from the generative model.

Let's play another game, this time for a ground truth unstained, bright-field image to be converted. The next two images on the right are the ground truth H&E version of the ground truth unstained image and the 
virtually stained H&E version of the ground truth unstained image. Can you guess which is "real" and which is "fake"?

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/1_project/us2_he_intro.png" title="US2HE_intro" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

The correct answer again is that the images in the right (column) are the "fake" ones, or the ones sampled from the generative model. 
If you look closely, you could tell that the images on the right have slight artifacts and may be a bit "awkward" in general, this is because
this is still a work in progress. With correct training, I hope to make them indistinguishable! The above two examples tell us the two different kinds of stain conversions 
that exist: 1) label-free-to-stain conversions and 2) stain-to-stain conversions. But someone may ask, **why do we want to do this? Why virtually stain or convert stains?**
