### ***Motivation:***
Let's play a simple guessing game: Look at the pictures below. Can you guess who is older?


*Pretty obvious, right?* Obviously left man is older and right man (Tom Brady) is younger. 

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/1_project/real_95yr_man.png" title="95 Year Old Man" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/1_project/Tom_Brady_44yr_old.png" title="44 Year Old Tom Brady" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    On the left, we have a 95 year old man, and on the right, we have 44 year old Tom Brady. 
</div>

Now, assume we were able to get the skin tissues of both man, cut them into serial sections, applied H&E stain to them, scanned/digitzed them, 
and then looked at one part of the whole slide images (WSI). Two pairs of pictures are shown below, and each man's H&E pictures are on the 
left and the right. *Can you answer the same question now?*
