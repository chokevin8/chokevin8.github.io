### **Project Motivation & Background:**

As the precision medicine era comes closer and closer, gone are the times when breast cancer patients are all grouped together for a new clinical trial.
Clinical biomarker studies that are conducted by pharmaceutical companies reveal the importance of biomarker-driven oncology clinical trials to not only boost
the clinical effectiveness of the drug, but also to position their drugs properly in the market. Nowadays, all cancer patients are divided into various tumor subtypes
based on a positive/negative testing for certain prognostic biomarkers for that specific type of cancer. For example, in breast cancer, the first-line therapy for 
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2-positive cancer are different. Additionally, even within a tumor subtype such as TNBC, the first-line therapy
may be different depending on whether one tests positive for a BRCA mutation or/and PD-L1 protein. Furthermore, while not a specific protein biomarker, general biomarkers such as
tumor mutation burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) can both be a great predictive biomarker to determine the best therapy for a patient.

Now, in the space of precision medicine, analyzing the patient's cancer transcriptome via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) allows to further analyze the heterogeneity of the tumor subtype
and possibly discover novel biomarkers or therapeutic strategies.
